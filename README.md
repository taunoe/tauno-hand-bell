# BELL Project

This is a fun project in which I created a mechanised system to ring a table bell powered by an ESP32 microcontroller and connected to the Blynk IoT cloud platform. The bell can be triggered through the Blynk API.
There are two ways to activate the bell:

- Manual Control: I built a simple webpage hosted on GitHub Pages with a button to manually ring the bell.
- Automated System: Using an old laptop with a webcam, I developed an automated system powered by a Python script utilizing the Ultralytics machine vision library. The system detects objects like people, cups, or other items, and when a match is found, it sends a signal to activate the bell.
